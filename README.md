# Azure Automation Scripts Repository

This repository contains a curated collection of **automation scripts**, runbooks, and helper tools for managing Azure environments. The primary focus is on **PowerShell-based Azure Automation Runbooks**, but it may also include support scripts written in other languages (e.g., Python, Bicep, ARM, or YAML).

These scripts are designed to streamline operational tasks, enforce consistency, reduce manual work, and integrate with CI/CD pipelines where applicable.
